I chose to create a finance app because I was in search of a robust solution for documenting and managing my finances. 
The goal was to move away from the current approach of using multiple, extensive Excel spreadsheets, and instead, consolidate everything into a single, efficient platform.

App Structure

The application consists of the 3 components

- Backend: NodeJS, ExpressJS, Typescript
- Database: PostgreSQL, node-pg-migrate
- Frontend: ReactJS, Typescript

Backend and Frontend communicate via a basic `RestAPI`

All the components are containerized in `Docker` containers.

To run the project you first need to clone the repo
```
git clone {repo}
```

Then to start the containers you run

```
docker-compose up -d
```

you can also build your container by
````
docker-compose up --build
````

eventually you can access the frontend from

http://localhost/3001

if you want to shutdown the process then use
````
docker-compose down 
````
or
````
docker-compose down -v
````
to remove the data volumes

Change the port in docker-compose for `frontend` if `3001` is blocked for any reason.***

 Demo
Below is how the dashboard looks like with some demo data

Currency is hardcoded as danish crowns (DKK) in the frontend


 Backend/Database
Backend communicates with Frontend via a REST API and stores the data in PostgeSQL.

The Data model consists of 3 tables that contain all the relevant information for the dashboard.

Transactions: The day to day expenses and income

Expense Categories: The main expenses areas (eg. Personal running costs)

Expense Types: More detailed expenses that belong to one of the main categories (eg. Restaurants)
